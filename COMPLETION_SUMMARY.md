## 💡 Example Transformation

### Before:
```markdown
# Interrupt Handling

Interrupts are signals from hardware devices that require 
immediate attention from the CPU.
```

### After:
```markdown
# Interrupt Handling

## 🎯 Layman's Explanation

**What is an Interrupt?**
Imagine you're reading a book, and suddenly your phone rings. 
You stop reading, answer the phone, then resume reading. 
That's exactly what an interrupt is!

[Followed by detailed flow diagrams and explanations]
